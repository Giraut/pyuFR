    Pure Python communication class for Digital Logic uFR-series NFC readers
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Python class to communicate with Digital Logic uFR-series NFC readers
such as the uFR Nano or Nano Online (https://www.d-logic.net/).

Communication options include serial, UDP, TCP and HTTP POST (REST).

See test routine at the bottom of the class for usage examples.



Why?

Digital Logic provides a full library for most platform that's perfectly usable
in Python (https://www.d-logic.net/code/nfc-rfid-reader-sdk/ufr-lib).
However, it has several drawbacks:

- Need to import a proprietary binary blob

- If your device uses a FTDI USB-to-serial interface, you must disable the
  native Linux FTDI kernel modules (ftdi_sio and usbserial), as it conflicts
  with the Digital Logic library. If you have other USB serial devices
  connected to your system, this is not an option.

- The Digital Logic library makes it difficult to debug low-level issues

Fortunately, Digital Logic is very open with their serial protocol and has
documented it fully and comprehensively. This class reimplements it in pure
Python.



                     /!\ WARNING: work in progress /!\

State of completion:

  - Core protocol fully implemented (sending commands, receiving answers over
    serial and network)

  - Front-end API calls (i.e. convenience functions to communicate with a
    reader "smartly") partially implemented. Currently basic device probing
    functions, a few configuration functions, sleep / reset functions and
    UID probing
